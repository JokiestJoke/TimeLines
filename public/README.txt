Ever find yourself browsing a wikia of your favorite historical events or fiction, but have been frustrated with miles of text?
Ever feel lost in the historical context as you flip from open tab to open tab of a internet browser? Public TimeLines is a project 
aimed at creating a creating a singular home for multiple user created public timelines. The goal of these timelines is to offer a 
clean cut visual aid to help any reader understand the true chronological order of any topic! So far the planned features are:

1) User created TimeLines
	a) Anyone can read for free 
	b) user can choose between historical or fictitious timelines (i.e. Athenian Golden Age versus Third Age of Middle Earth)
	c) user can edit or suggest an addition, which will be considered pending.
2) Users can "upvote" suggested  changes, which are all pending editr or additions.
